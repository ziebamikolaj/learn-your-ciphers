  "quickDescription": "Learn the Vigenère Cipher, one of the most widely used encryption methods in the history of cryptography.",
  "description": "The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword. It employs a form of polyalphabetic substitution.",
  "example": "For example, if the keyword is 'KEY', the first letter of the plaintext would be shifted by the value of 'K', the second by 'E', the third by 'Y', then cycling back to 'K' for the fourth letter, and so on.",

  "historicalContext": "Historical Context",
  "history": "The cipher is named after Blaise de Vigenère, although it was first described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553. The cipher was considered unbreakable for centuries, earning it the nickname 'le chiffre indéchiffrable' (the indecipherable cipher).",
  "modernUse": "While the Vigenère cipher is much more secure than simple substitution ciphers, it can still be broken with enough ciphertext and computational power. However, it remains an important part of cryptography history and is often used as an educational tool.",

  "ciphertextPlaceholder": "Encrypted text will appear here",
  "howItWorks": "How It Works",
  "step1": "Each letter of the plaintext is paired with a letter from the keyword.",
  "step2": "The keyword is repeated to match the length of the plaintext.",
  "step3": "Each letter pair is converted to their numeric values (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25).",
  "step4": "The values are added together, modulo 26.",
  "step5": "The resulting number is converted back to a letter, forming the ciphertext.",

  "keyRepetition": "Key Repetition",
  "keyRepetitionExplanation": "The key ({{keyLength}} characters) is shorter than the plaintext ({{textLength}} characters). The key is repeated as needed to match the length of the plaintext. That's why you see the key letters cyclically repeating in the visualization.",
