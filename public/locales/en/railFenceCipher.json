  "description": "The Rail Fence cipher is a transposition cipher that derives its name from the zigzag pattern in which the message is written out. It's a simple but effective way to encrypt messages.",

  "explanationTitle": "How It Works",
  "explanation": "The Rail Fence cipher works by writing the message in a zigzag pattern on a grid with a specified number of rails, then reading off each rail to form the ciphertext. For decryption, the process is reversed. The number of rails determines the complexity of the encryption.",
  "historyTitle": "History",
  "historyContent": "The Rail Fence cipher is one of the oldest and simplest forms of encryption. It has been used in various forms since ancient times, with one of its earliest known uses dating back to the Spartan military in ancient Greece. They used a device called a scytale, which was essentially a physical implementation of the Rail Fence cipher.",
  "example": "For example, with 3 rails, the plaintext 'HELLO WORLD' becomes 'HOLELWRDLO' when encrypted.",
