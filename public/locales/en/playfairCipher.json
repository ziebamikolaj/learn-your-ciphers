  "description": "The Playfair cipher is a manual symmetric encryption technique and was the first literal digraph substitution cipher. It employs a 5x5 grid of letters constructed using a keyword.",
  "example": "For example, using the keyword 'MONARCHY', the grid would start with those letters (excluding duplicates) and then fill in the remaining alphabet. The letters 'I' and 'J' are typically combined into one cell.",

  "history": "The Playfair cipher was invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone, but it bears the name of Lord Playfair who promoted the use of the cipher. It was used for tactical purposes by British forces in the Second Boer War and in World War I.",
  "modernUse": "While no longer considered secure for modern cryptographic purposes, the Playfair cipher is still an interesting example of a digraph substitution cipher and is often used in puzzles and as an educational tool in cryptography courses.",
