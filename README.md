# Learn Your Ciphers

## About the Project

Learn Your Ciphers is an interactive educational platform designed to teach cryptography, focusing on classical ciphers such as Caesar and Vigenère. This project aims to visualize the encryption and decryption processes, making it easier for users to understand these fundamental cryptographic techniques.

## Features

- Interactive demonstrations of Caesar and Vigenère ciphers
- Step-by-step visualization of encryption and decryption processes
- Multilingual support (English and Polish)
- Responsive design for various devices

## Built With

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/)
